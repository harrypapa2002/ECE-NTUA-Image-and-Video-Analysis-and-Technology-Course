## Project 1: Image Pyramid Construction and Analysis
### Overview
This project focuses on implementing and analyzing image pyramids, which are fundamental in multiscale image processing. Key tasks include:
- Theoretical exploration of Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids, including entropy calculation and quantization effects.
- Practical implementation of functions to generate Gaussian and Laplacian pyramids, perform pyramid-based encoding and decoding, and apply quantization.
- Testing implementations on grayscale and color images (e.g., `Lena` and `camera`) with variations in parameters (e.g., pyramid depth, entropy analysis).

### Files
- **`Project1_ImagePyramidAnalysis.pdf`**: Project description with theoretical and practical details for Gaussian and Laplacian pyramid implementations.
- **`Image_Pyramid_Analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook containing implementation code, test cases, and analysis for the image pyramid methods.

## Project 2: Deep Learning Architectures for Image Recognition
### Overview
This project involves studying and comparing different deep learning architectures for image recognition on the CIFAR-100 dataset. The main tasks include:
- A comparative analysis of popular convolutional network architectures (e.g., LeNet, AlexNet, VGG) with respect to their structure, parameter count, and performance features.
- Implementing and evaluating a subset of CIFAR-100 using team-specific data seeds to generate unique training samples.
- Applying and analyzing different architectural elements, including pooling, dropout, and activation functions, to observe their impact on model accuracy and robustness.

### Files
- **`Project2_DeepLearningArchitectures.pdf`**: Project description detailing the theoretical analysis and practical implementation tasks with CIFAR-100.
- **`DeepLearning_Architectures_Comparison.ipynb`**: Jupyter notebook for implementing network architectures, conducting experiments, and analyzing results.
